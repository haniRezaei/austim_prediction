# austim_prediction
I have worked on an autism prediction project, analyzing and visualizing categorical features in this dataset.
the code loads training and test datasets, checks for missing values, replaces question marks (?) with NaNs, and separates the categorical and numerical columns. The last section of the code involves visualizing the relationship between categorical features like gender, ethnicity, jaundice, autism history, etc., and the target variable.
Handle missing values: You might want to address the missing values in ethnicity and relation before moving forward. You can choose strategies like filling them with the most frequent value (mode), dropping rows, or using more sophisticated techniques like imputation based on other features.
Converting the age feature to an integer type might help with simplicity in visualization and machine learning models.
Data balancing: If target variable Class/ASD is imbalanced, this could affect the model. You could consider using techniques like SMOTE during modeling.
To prepare for machine learning models, categorical features need to be encoded. You can use techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding, depending on the model you are using.
you could investigate the distribution of age and result to check for outliers.
After cleaning the data, you could apply classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict autism cases.
this kind of data could be used for classification purposes in machine learning, where various features would be used to predict whether an individual falls into the "ASD positive" or "ASD negative" class.
